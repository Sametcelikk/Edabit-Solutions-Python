This is an introduction to how challenges on Edabit work. In the Code tab above
you'll see a starter function that looks like this:

def hello():

All you have to do is type return "hello edabit.com" on the second line and then
click the Check button. If you did this correctly, the button will turn red and say SUBMIT FINAL.
Click it and see what happens.
