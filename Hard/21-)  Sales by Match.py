"""
Given a list of integers representing the color of each sock, determine how many
pairs of socks with matching colors there are. For example, there are 7 socks
with colors [1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 3, 2]. There is one pair of color 1 and one of color 2.
There are three odd socks left, one of each color. The number of pairs is 2.

Create a function that returns an integer representing the number of matching pairs
of socks that are available.

Examples
sock_merchant([10, 20, 20, 10, 10, 30, 50, 10, 20]) ➞ 3

sock_merchant([50, 20, 30, 90, 30, 20, 50, 20, 90]) ➞ 4

sock_merchant([]) ➞ 0
