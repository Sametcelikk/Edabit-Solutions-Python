"""
Create a function that returns the majority vote in a list.
A majority vote is an element that occurs > N/2 times in a
list (where N is the length of the list).

Examples
majority_vote(["A", "A", "B"]) ➞ "A"

majority_vote(["A", "A", "A", "B", "C", "A"]) ➞ "A"

majority_vote(["A", "B", "B", "A", "C", "C"]) ➞ None
Notes

The frequency of the majority element must be strictly greater than 1/2.
If there is no majority element, return None.
If the list is empty, return None.
