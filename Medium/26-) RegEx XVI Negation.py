"""
The caret ^, when found at the start of a characer set, is the equivalent to "not" in RegEx.
The regular expression [^a-c] matches any characters except "a", "b" and "c". Write the regular
expression that matches any characters except letters, digits and spaces. You must use a negated
character set in your expression.

Examples
txt = " alice15@gmail.com "
pattern = "yourregularexpressionhere"

re.findall(pattern, txt) âžž ["@", "."]

Notes
You don't need to write a function, just the pattern.
Do not remove import re from the code.

import re
